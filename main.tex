\title{Automated Deprecated-API Usage Update for Android Apps: How Far Are We?}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Over time, Android apps may become out-of-date. Some APIs may be deprecated and eventually removed. App developers need to make their apps up-to-date to ensure that the apps still work in both older and newer versions of Android. %However, updating apps correctly is not always easy as developers need to understand how to properly update the deprecated APIs. The APIs may also be used in multiple locations so updating them could be cumbersome and time consuming. 
To date, AppEvolve is the state-of-the-art approach that has been proposed to automate such updates, specifically for the case of deprecated API method. In its own work, AppEvolve has been shown to be quite effective by producing applicable updates for 85\% of target API changes in 90.24\% of their usage locations. In this work, we replicate AppEvolve experiment and further evaluate whether its effectiveness in generating applicable updates is generalizable. We use the same set of APIs from AppEvolve and find other mobile apps that use these APIs. Our experiments show that AppEvolve fails to generate applicable updates for 81.48\% of our dataset. This failure occurs even though the relevant knowledge is available in the examples that AppEvolve learns from. We categorize AppEvolve limitations that lead to this failure. %One of the limitations is its incapability to apply edits to target app code that only has minor syntactical difference with the example the edits are learned from. 
We show that one of the limitation can be mitigated by performing simple refactoring on the app code to resemble the code in the example, which makes AppEvolve can generate applicable updates for 81.82\% where the applicable updates were failed to be generated. Based on these findings, we propose promising future directions for automatic update of deprecated-API usage in Android apps.
