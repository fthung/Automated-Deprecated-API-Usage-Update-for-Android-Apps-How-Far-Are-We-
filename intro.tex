Mobile apps are an integral part of a modern life. To keep up with increasing users' needs and demands, they may need to be frequently updated following the frequent updates of the underlying mobile operating system (OS)~\cite{bavota2014impact,han2012understanding,linares2013api,mcdonnell2013empirical,yang2018android}. App developers may need to maintain backward compatibility with different versions of the mobile OS to reach as many users as possible. To do so, developers need to update the APIs accordingly so that the same mobile apps can run without problems in the past and future versions of the mobile OS.

Unfortunately, updating APIs correctly is not always trivial. While API changes are described in documentation, examples of how to adapt to the API changes are not always available, especially if there is a need to maintain backward compatibility due to OS fragmentation~\cite{he2018understanding,li2018cid}. Moreover, the APIs to update may be used in many different locations in the mobile apps and thus updating them manually one by one is time consuming and error prone.

To automate the process of updating Android apps, Fazzini et al. proposed a technique named AppEvolve~\cite{fazzini2019automated}. To the best of our knowledge, AppEvolve is the state-of-the-art technique for automatic update of API-usage for Android apps. More specifically, it targets updates of deprecated-API usages. AppEvolve works by collecting information from existing code examples that already have gone through the update process. AppEvolve accepts as input a target Android app and information about API changes between two Android versions. It works in four phases. The first phase identifies code fragments in the target app that are affected by the API change. The second phase searches existing codebases for examples of the API change. The third phase generalizes each example into a form of generic code patch. These code patches are then ranked. In the fourth and final phase, it applies the generic code patches one at a time according to their ranking. Succesful application means that AppEvolve can produce applicable updates. These applicable updates are tested and labeled validated if the tests run without errors. The validated update is return to users. If none of the updates are validated, AppEvolve returns all applicable updates.

AppEvolve has been evaluated on a dataset involving 15 real-world apps and 20 real API changes. The dataset contains 41 usage locations of these real API changes. AppEvolve successfully produce applicable updates for 85\% of these API changes and 90.24\% of their usage locations. In this work, our goal is to analyze the characteristics of cases in which AppEvolve cannot generate applicable updates. We started by analyzing the original dataset that is made available by AppEvolve authors.\footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/view/appevolve}} Next, we searched for additional mobile apps that use APIs in the original AppEvolve dataset. We applied AppEvolve to update these mobile apps and analyzed in detail the cases where it fails to update the apps.

Running AppEvolve on the combination of AppEvolve dataset and ours results in the generation of 10 applicable updates and 44 failed updates. Our analysis shows that AppEvolve produces applicable updates for a mobile app in cases where the API usage match the API change examples.  On the other hand, in most cases, AppEvolve fails to update a mobile app due to minor syntactical difference between invocation of the deprecated method in the example and the target app. It also fails when encountering edits that require modifications beyond method boundaries, unsupported programming language features, and no examples found in GitHub.

We mitigate cases of minor syntactical difference by performing simple refactoring in order to convert the target app code to resemble the example from which AppEvolve learns the edits from. After this simple refactoring, we found that AppEvolve can generate applicable updates for 81.82\% of cases where it previously failed to do so. Based on the discovered limitations in AppEvolve and our mitigations result, we propose promising future directions to improve updates of deprecated-API usage update in Android apps, such as normalizing code to a standard form coupled with identifier name recommendation.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have added additional Android apps to evaluate how well a state-of-the-art automatic API-usage update for Android apps tool named AppEvolve can actually perform an API-usage update in different situations.
    \item We categorized the limitations of AppEvolve and show instances of API usage instances in which these limitations can be demonstrated.
    \item We discuss how the limitations may possibly be overcome to improve the automatic API-usage update for Android apps.
    \item We release a replication package to allow easy replication and evaluation of our experiments and results.\footnote{\url{...}}
