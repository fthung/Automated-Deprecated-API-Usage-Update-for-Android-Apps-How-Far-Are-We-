AppEvolve is the state-of-the-art approach for automatic update of
deprecated-API usage in Android apps. Experiments previously reported for
AppEvolve have shown that it can generate applicable updates for
85.00\% of these API
changes and 90.24\% of their usage locations on mobile apps in the
AppEvolve dataset.

In this work, we evaluate whether this observed effectiveness is
generalizable. We add 54 additional mobile apps that use the APIs contained
in the AppEvolve dataset. Running AppEvolve on these mobile apps shows that
AppEvolve fails to generate applicable updates for 81.48\% of the mobile
apps. By analyzing these failed cases, we found that they failed mainly
due to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Statements in the examples and at the target location are structurally different.
    \item Object and arguments of the deprecated API method are in the form of complex expressions.
    \item Edits are required beyond method boundaries.
    \item Incomplete support of programming language features.
    \item No examples found in GitHub.
\end{enumerate}
We mitigate the first and the second categories by performing a simple
refactoring that modifies the code containing API usage in the target app
to resemble the one in the example. Our mitigations enable AppEvolve
to generate applicable updates for 81.82\% of the failed cases.

Our results suggest that the results previously obtained with AppEvolve do
not generalize beyond their dataset.  By studying and example in the
dataset and one of its corresponing change examples, it appears that the
developers of AppEvolve normalized the evaluated change examples and target
apps in a manner analogous to our mitigation, although this normalization
does not appear to be reported in the AppEvolve paper.  We propose that
applying such a mitigation systematically, combined with identifier name
recommendation and refactoring of the generated code to restore the
original coding style may be worth exploring for the future use of
AppEvolve.
